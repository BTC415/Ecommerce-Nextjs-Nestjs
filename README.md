# Elecshop - eCommerce app w/ Next.js, Nest.js and MongoDB

![Elecshop preview image](./client/public/design/preview.png)

## The Challenge ‚ö°Ô∏è

I wanted to build another eCommerce website using newer technologies than my [previous eCommerce project](https://github.com/NightClover-code/basic-eCommerce-website), where I used `Firebase` to store data and `Redux` for state management.

I went with a `client-server` approach, and this time I mixed two frameworks for the first time, which were `Next.js` and `Nest.js`.

This project was very fun to build, as I encountred multiple challenges on how to coordinate between a fast, secure, and strictly-typed Nest.js API; and a Next.js app based on client-side fetching.

Here was the challenge:

- Server-side full-featured shopping cart from scratch.
- Storing product reviews and ratings for every customer.
- Adding pagination & searching features for products.
- User account management & saving product orders.
- Admin profile & product management.
- Fast checkout process (shipping, payment method, etc).

## Built With ‚ú®

- [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/) - node.js framework
- React Bootstrap - UI library
- Redux - State management library
- JWT - tokens for authentication
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - react.js framework
- MongoDB - Document database
- Typescript
